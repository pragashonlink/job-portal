NOTE: 

- It's important to do rate limiting since, our application is going to receive requests to create data from multiple clients. Failing to do so could have consequences such as flooding of requests(DOS attacks).

- Each applicant should Login/Signup before submitting his profile

- Commission calculation per client
    2 roles * 2 positions
    (
        Software Engineer Role - 2 Candidates/Positions,
        SSE Role - 2 Candidates/Positions
    )

    SE Applications - Candidate 1 - 50000, Candidate 2 - 60000, Candidate 3 - 70000. Average 60000
    SSE Applications - Candidate 1 - 150000, Candidate 2 - 160000, Candidate 3 - 170000. Average 160000

    60000 * 0.1 * 2 + 160000 * 0.1 * 2 = 12000 + 32000 = 44,000
